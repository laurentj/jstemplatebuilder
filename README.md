# jsTemplateBuilder

This is a template engine made created in august 2004, for XUL content, and since 1.3 (2005), it works for HTML.

This is an old project. I didn't touch it since 2005 except the HTML example. Probably it has some issues on modern browsers.


- Read [my old blog post](http://ljouanneau.com/blog/post/2004/08/18/329-jstemplatebuilder) to know more about it.
  Note that this blog post talks only about XUL in Firefox addons, but it works also for HTML in web pages.
